# Synapse Provider

The Synapse provider provides resources to interact with a Synapse admin API.

You must create an admin user like indicated in [Synapse's
documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html).

You can then use the `username` and `password` as the example below shows.
